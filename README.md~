yogaflows
=========

Code for yogaflo.ws, a website that lets you drag around cards representing yoga poses in order to create sequences, or "flows." You can then share the flows with your friends by copying and pasting the resulting URL.

Currently pre-alpha. The URLs for any flows you make could potentially break at any time.
